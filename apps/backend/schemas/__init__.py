"""Lightâ€‘weight schema objects used in the tests.

The real project employs Pydantic models for request/response validation.  To
keep the dependency footprint small for the kata's unit tests we implement the
minimal data structures as simple ``dataclasses``.  Only the fields exercised in
the tests are included.
